README

This is a collection of scripts to use when making various Circos plots of a genome/chromosome.
They are used to generate the data files that Circos needs.
Please see the comments at the beginning of each file for a description of how to use the script.

CircosHighlights.pl - for creating a highlight plot of specific genes
GBFtoCircos.pl - for plotting forward- and reverse-strand genes
IndelstoCircos.pl - for plotting indels/kb
SNPtoCircos.pl - for plotting SNPs/kb
