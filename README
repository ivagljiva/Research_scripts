README

This is a collection of various Perl scripts that I have created and used in genomics research
projects during my undergraduate study.

They are free for anyone to use and modify for their own projects; credit/citations are, of course,
appreciated.

As many of these are older scripts, often written with specific input file formats (I was and am still
learning to code better), please take care to read the script comments to determine how to get them working
properly. None of the scripts will overwrite your input data, but unexpected output may be a result
of improper usage.

I welcome comments, questions, and suggestions; particularly if you notice any bugs.
