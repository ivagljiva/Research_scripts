README

This is a collection of scripts that help with manual curation of prokaryotic genome annotation.
I typically use PROKKA to automatically generate initial annotations, then manually curate these.
Several of the scripts are meant to work with a file of a certain format, products.txt, which
is generated by parsing an annotation file to extract the locus tag and predicted annotation for each protein.
The format of each line in such a products.txt file is:
locus_tag\tpredicted annotation

Please see the comments at the top of each script for an explanation of how to use them.

The following scripts are used individually:
hypotheticals.pl - finds all annotated hypothetical proteins and puts them in a list, for verification
lcaser.pl - converts certain protein annotations to lowercase, to follow NCBI nomenclature guidelines

The following scripts are used together in the following workflow to speed up manual curation of product names:
1) markChanges.pl - compares original products.txt and manually curated products.txt, and creates a list of the changes
2) validChanges.pl - parses the output of markChanges.pl to find unique modifications
3) reannotate.pl - uses the output of validChanges.pl to apply these unique annotation modifications to other products.txt files
    (also marks those annotations that have not been automatically fixed and must be manually checked)
